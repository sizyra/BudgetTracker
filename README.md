## Installation
Clone the repository using the link (https://github.com/sizyra/BudgetTracker.git), then use your CLI to run "npm install" and, when all dependencies are installed, run "node server.js" to start your server. Alternatively, use the deployed app on heroku with this link (https://obscure-plains-80065.herokuapp.com/).

## Errors
I've been running into a number of strange heroku errors lately, preventing the app from deploying properly. The build log says it succeeded, but the logs in my CLI state that the app crashed a number of times before failing entirely and I can't figure out why. The local version works just fine.

## Usage
Once you've got the app running, your only option should be to click a button that says "Add a workout!" Select this and enter the workouts you've completed, either Cardio or Resistance. You can enter multiple workouts by clicking "Add Exercise" once all information is entered. 

When you're done, click "Complete" to finish adding. This will return you to the main page which now displays some stats. For graphs and more info, click "Dashboard" on the top left. To return to the home page, click "Fitness Tracker" on the top left. Enjoy!
